I used to live in a really crappy house as a kid. That house was really creepy. At night, the windows would always rattle. One night, i was staying at home alone. At the time, we didn't have electricity, so it was pitch black inside. I tried to go to bed, curled up in my bed. But then, i realized something. "Hey, the rattling noise is louder than usual." I thought to myself. I was scared, but as though I was drawn by something, I walked towards the window. I slowly opened the curtain, took a look outside the window, and I noticed... that the wind was stronger than usual. \(\=\w\=\)\
