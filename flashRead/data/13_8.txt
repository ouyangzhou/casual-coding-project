I went to this one shabby fishing village in the countryside.
It was as if time had stopped in this village.
It was a pretty spooky place to begin with, but at the bed and breakfast where we stayed, there was even a crumbling statue of Kinjiro Ninomiya facing the ocean.
According to the proprietress of the inn, that statue turns around to glare behind him at night to make sure none of the children staying at the inn are awake.
"So, you must never stay up late." said the proprietress.
When I heard that, it made me want to see if it was true.
So a bunch of us kids snuck out in the middle of the night.
It was truly the dead of night.
Even thinking back now, I wish we hadn't gone, but...
It was pitch black. And the weather was bad, too. The wind sounded like people moaning...
We waited for 10 minutes, then 20. It was summer, but oddly chilly.
And suddenly, we looked around and we couldn't believe our eyes!


Before we knew it, we'd fallen asleep and the morning had come.
